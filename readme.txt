Image Generator Web App

This web app allows users to generate images based on prompts. The images are generated by an external service and can be added to a collage at the top of the page. The images in the collage are stored in a Supabase database.

Deployment Instructions:
1. Replace '<your-image-generation-api-url>' and '<your-image-generation-api-key>' in 'netlify/functions/generate-image.js' with your image generation API URL and key.
2. Replace '<your-supabase-url>' and '<your-supabase-api-key>' in 'app.js' with your Supabase URL and API key.
3. Deploy the app to Netlify. The 'netlify/functions' directory will automatically be deployed as serverless Lambda functions.
4. Enjoy your image generating web app!
